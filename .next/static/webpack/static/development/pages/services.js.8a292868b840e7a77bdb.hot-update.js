Our highly skilled project teams work with many of the major oil and gas companies and also the major topside contractors and fabricators to deliver world class drilling facilities for some of the most challenging oilfields and locations. As an integral part of the KCA Deutag group, our core business is to deliver a comprehensive drilling facilities engineering service at every stage of design, engineering, construction and modification; using the expertise of our engineers and operations experts to ensure the end product is capable of delivering safe, effective, trouble-free operations.  Through our global offices in Aberdeen, Baku, Bergen, Houston, London and St. John\u2019s (Canada) we are well positioned to deliver project work anywhere in the world. Our services include: Engineering design for new-builds: RDS' primary focus is large, harsh environment platform drilling rigs and drilling packages for mobile drilling units. Our greenfield capabilities can take a project from drawing board concept stage into front end engineering design (FEED) and through detailed design, including specification and management of the procurement of drilling equipment. Rig reactivation or modification: Whether a minor piping reconfiguration or an entire rig reactivation, an offshore platform or land rig, RDS provides engineering services throughout all stages of a brownfield project. We support brownfield modifications in many countries from our offices in Aberdeen, Bergen and Baku. Conceptual engineering and consultancy: RDS provides enhanced focus on the earliest phase of major projects through a group of experts who specialise in the delivery of high quality concept studies. This team also offers drilling facilities and drilling operations consultancy services which can be applied in a variety of scenarios and across all types of rigs. Construction and commissioning support: RDS provides specialist drilling input during the construction and commissioning phases of new-build and modification projects. Our approach is to assemble a team that works in an integrated manner alongside the shipyard or topside contractor. This team is responsible for assisting the client in the delivery of a drill rig ready and safe to begin drilling operations. \u201CAt RDS our goal is to engineer the safest and most efficient rigs and to exceed clients expectations as we do so.   Being part of the wider KCA Deutag group, and having access to the operational experience from the other divisions is a key part of this goal.
