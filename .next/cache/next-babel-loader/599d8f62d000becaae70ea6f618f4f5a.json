We operate in a wide range of environments, from the extreme temperatures of the Sahara to the remote and arctic conditions of Siberia.\r\n\r\nWe have an ongoing rig building and upgrade programme which develops new and innovative rig designs helping us deliver our vision of operating safely, succeeding globally.\r\n\r\nWe are also innovating the software and hardware of our existing rigs to improve performance and deliver value through cost efficient well construction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we offer the rental of a wide portfolio of high quality drilling and production equipment, maintained and certified in accordance with recognised industry standards and PetroGas Group's own worldwide standards. Our Equipment Rentals brochure can be found here.\r\n\r\n“PetroGas Group has a strong track record in delivering value for our clients through cost effective well construction.  Our focus is on meeting our clients’ goals for their drilling projects, whilst ensuring safe, effective, trouble-free operations. Our presence in most key energy regions and our focus on developing local personnel means we are well placed to continue to successfully deliver for our clients whilst developing local value and skills in the countries in which we operate.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<hr />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  </section>\r\n\r\n  <section >\r\n    \r\n    <h2>Offshore</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n<img src=\"/offshore-rig.jpg\" alt=\"offshore image\" /> <br />\r\n\r\nWith over 40 years of platform drilling experience, PetroGas Group is one of the world's largest platform services operators.\r\n\r\nToday we are responsible, either directly or through our affiliates, for managing drilling and maintenance operations on 29 offshore platforms across the North Sea, the Caspian Sea, Sakhalin Island, Canada and West Africa.  In addition, we are also contracted to manage operations and maintenance on two Gusto CJ70 Jack Ups, operating in the Norwegian North Sea.\r\n\r\n<h4>Unrivalled knowledge and expertise</h4>\r\n\r\nWe have formalised a pragmatic approach to deliver safe, effective, trouble-free platform drilling operations across our blue chip client base. This approach, coupled with; our unrivalled knowledge of delivering platform wells, extensive experience in asset and rig equipment management, together with a fresh perspective on working with the main service providers, places PetroGas Group in a unique position to offer innovative solutions which deliver value and exceptional performance.\r\n\r\nDelivery of complete end to end drilling facilities' solutions\r\n\r\nThe drilling facilities for many of our platforms have been designed by our global specialist engineering division RDS. Many of these projects combine the experience of operations experts with specialists in rig design, to offer complete end to end solutions. Working closely in this manner allows us to deliver integrated solutions through the concept stage, design and build and onto operations, maintenance and engineering support.\r\n\r\nComprehensive experience in plug and abandonment projects\r\n\r\nOver recent years, PetroGas Group has delivered significant plug and abandonment scopes. These have required proactive rig operations and maintenance activities as well as rig modifications. We have made a progressive effort to establish collaborative working relationships with service providers to increase efficiency and reduce operating time per well.  Our track record for P&A operations is comprehensive, and our onshore and offshore workforce is therefore very familiar with P&A regulations, planning and execution.\r\n\r\n<h4>Delivery Focused</h4>\r\n\r\nIt is frequently said that \"companies make contracts and people make business\".  To ensure effective collaboration both must be aligned. We believe that strong collaborative working relationships enable the successful delivery of well objectives. The way in which we work has evolved from one of managed support for our clients to one of aligned objectives so that we work as one team.\r\n\r\n<h4>Planning For Success</h4>\r\n\r\nPetroGas Group firmly believes that the path to success is through delivering trouble-free operations that are well planned so that we get the job right the first time, and every time. This includes ensuring that we have a highly competent team in place which is involved and committed right from the start.\r\n\r\nIn practical terms, we believe that low NPT is a key \"driver\" in securing consistently high performance and well delivery. A vital element of delivering low NPT is equipment reliability. We have invested heavily in new technology and data collection capability to enable us to plan and successfully execute maintenance programmes, based on the inherent condition of the equipment in use. This allows us to plan and undertake maintenance with minimal interruption to the ongoing operation and avoid any failures which could impact performance.\r\n\r\n<h4>A Strong Safety Culture</h4>\r\n\r\nSafety is of paramount importance to the group and our priority is incident free operations, where nobody gets hurt and we don't harm the environment.  These beliefs are visible through our HSE Policy and Worldwide HSE Standards:\r\n\r\nWe routinely deliver best in class performance and are widely recognised for delivering safe operations\r\nOur behavioural safety programs are focused on reducing all incidents, recordable or not, to zero\r\nWe believe that maintaining a highly skilled and motivated work force is key to eliminating all incidents\r\nOur front line safety tools are simple and fit for purpose\r\n \r\n“We consciously choose not to allow luck to play a part in delivering safe, effective, trouble-free drilling operations. This approach of delivering day-by-day, section-by-section and well-by-well takes commitment, belief and passion to succeed. Our range of key clients demonstrates our strong reputation which is supported by the work we do to deliver drilling operations The PetroGas Group Way.”\r\n    </p>\r\n   \r\n<br />\r\n<hr />\r\n<br />\r\n <br />\r\n  </section>\r\n\r\n  <section >\r\n    <h2>RDS</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n<img src=\"/rds.jpg\" alt=\"RDS rig image\" /> <br />\r\nRDS is the world's leading rig design and engineering specialist.
