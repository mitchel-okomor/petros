    <h2>Offshore</h2>
    <p>
<img src="/offshore-rig.jpg" alt="offshore image" /> <br />

With over 40 years of platform drilling experience, PetroGas Group is one of the world's largest platform services operators.

Today we are responsible, either directly or through our affiliates, for managing drilling and maintenance operations on 29 offshore platforms across the North Sea, the Caspian Sea, Sakhalin Island, Canada and West Africa.  In addition, we are also contracted to manage operations and maintenance on two Gusto CJ70 Jack Ups, operating in the Norwegian North Sea.

<h4>Unrivalled knowledge and expertise</h4>

We have formalised a pragmatic approach to deliver safe, effective, trouble-free platform drilling operations across our blue chip client base. This approach, coupled with; our unrivalled knowledge of delivering platform wells, extensive experience in asset and rig equipment management, together with a fresh perspective on working with the main service providers, places PetroGas Group in a unique position to offer innovative solutions which deliver value and exceptional performance.

Delivery of complete end to end drilling facilities' solutions

The drilling facilities for many of our platforms have been designed by our global specialist engineering division RDS. Many of these projects combine the experience of operations experts with specialists in rig design, to offer complete end to end solutions. Working closely in this manner allows us to deliver integrated solutions through the concept stage, design and build and onto operations, maintenance and engineering support.

Comprehensive experience in plug and abandonment projects

Over recent years, PetroGas Group has delivered significant plug and abandonment scopes. These have required proactive rig operations and maintenance activities as well as rig modifications. We have made a progressive effort to establish collaborative working relationships with service providers to increase efficiency and reduce operating time per well.  Our track record for P&A operations is comprehensive, and our onshore and offshore workforce is therefore very familiar with P&A regulations, planning and execution.

<h4>Delivery Focused</h4>

It is frequently said that "companies make contracts and people make business".  To ensure effective collaboration both must be aligned. We believe that strong collaborative working relationships enable the successful delivery of well objectives. The way in which we work has evolved from one of managed support for our clients to one of aligned objectives so that we work as one team.

<h4>Planning For Success</h4>

PetroGas Group firmly believes that the path to success is through delivering trouble-free operations that are well planned so that we get the job right the first time, and every time. This includes ensuring that we have a highly competent team in place which is involved and committed right from the start.

In practical terms, we believe that low NPT is a key "driver" in securing consistently high performance and well delivery. A vital element of delivering low NPT is equipment reliability. We have invested heavily in new technology and data collection capability to enable us to plan and successfully execute maintenance programmes, based on the inherent condition of the equipment in use. This allows us to plan and undertake maintenance with minimal interruption to the ongoing operation and avoid any failures which could impact performance.

<h4>A Strong Safety Culture</h4>

Safety is of paramount importance to the group and our priority is incident free operations, where nobody gets hurt and we don't harm the environment.  These beliefs are visible through our HSE Policy and Worldwide HSE Standards:

We routinely deliver best in class performance and are widely recognised for delivering safe operations
Our behavioural safety programs are focused on reducing all incidents, recordable or not, to zero
We believe that maintaining a highly skilled and motivated work force is key to eliminating all incidents
Our front line safety tools are simple and fit for purpose
 
“We consciously choose not to allow luck to play a part in delivering safe, effective, trouble-free drilling operations. This approach of delivering day-by-day, section-by-section and well-by-well takes commitment, belief and passion to succeed. Our range of key clients demonstrates our strong reputation which is supported by the work we do to deliver drilling operations The PetroGas Group Way.”

<img src="/rds.jpg" alt="RDS rig image" /> <br />
RDS is the world's leading rig design and engineering specialist.  Our highly skilled project teams work with many of the major oil and gas companies and also the major topside contractors and fabricators to deliver world class drilling facilities for some of the most challenging oilfields and locations.  

As an integral part of the PetroGas group, our core business is to deliver a comprehensive drilling facilities engineering service at every stage of design, engineering, construction and modification; using the expertise of our engineers and operations experts to ensure the end product is capable of delivering safe, effective, trouble-free operations.  Through our global offices in Aberdeen, Baku, Bergen, Houston, London and St. John’s (Canada) we are well positioned to deliver project work anywhere in the world. 

Our services include:

Engineering design for new-builds: RDS' primary focus is large, harsh environment platform drilling rigs and drilling packages for mobile drilling units. Our greenfield capabilities can take a project from drawing board concept stage into front end engineering design (FEED) and through detailed design, including specification and management of the procurement of drilling equipment.

Rig reactivation or modification: Whether a minor piping reconfiguration or an entire rig reactivation, an offshore platform or land rig, RDS provides engineering services throughout all stages of a brownfield project. We support brownfield modifications in many countries from our offices in Aberdeen, Bergen and Baku.

Conceptual engineering and consultancy: RDS provides enhanced focus on the earliest phase of major projects through a group of experts who specialise in the delivery of high quality concept studies. This team also offers drilling facilities and drilling operations consultancy services which can be applied in a variety of scenarios and across all types of rigs.

Construction and commissioning support: RDS provides specialist drilling input during the construction and commissioning phases of new-build and modification projects. Our approach is to assemble a team that works in an integrated manner alongside the shipyard or topside contractor. This team is responsible for assisting the client in the delivery of a drill rig ready and safe to begin drilling operations.

“At RDS our goal is to engineer the safest and most efficient rigs and to exceed clients expectations as we do so.   Being part of the wider PetroGas group, and having access to the operational experience from the other divisions is a key part of this goal.  The requirements for automation, safety in design, environmental protection, harsh environment facilities and efficient operations continue to increase rapidly and RDS strives to lead the industry in these areas.”
